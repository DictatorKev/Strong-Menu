# League_Bot_Health

If I have the time, I will make a window and easy use in the future, so you don't have to use any python tool to run the script -.-


A bot that heals you automatically or uses ult as soon as you need it (very fast reaction and is kept simple so it won't be detected)

Reading memory and executing keyboard-commands.

you like to heal by a specific amount of health?
May you get extra health if you heal at a specific point of your health, let's say under 20% or under exact 200 health?

just typ it in my script and it will automatically execute the command, so you can concentrate more on other things like dodging, focusing the right enemy, farming etc.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What you need:
Install: PIL
Install: pyautogui
both for keyboard


You have to indicate :
- the required health to execute.
- the key that will be pressed (example.. F for Heal)
- Static/Dynamic address of the source (can be found by using tools such as cheat engine, alternatives similar to cheat engine, google or reverse engineering the game) 
- cooldown of your spell. note, you have to change the ult value individiualy once the cooldown changes (doesn't include summoner spells since they always stay the same over the entire game).



to end the script... go to your application which is running python and close it.

Using Visual Code?
CTRL+C will end the process
